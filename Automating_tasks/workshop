#Workshop: Automating Tasks

##My script

    #!/bin/bash

    #This script will compare the contents of two weekly Argo reports on hydrus items and report back all the newly-accessioned items that I am interested in. See details below.

    #To run this
    #bash argo_comparisons.sh [name of first report file for comparison] [name of second report file for comparison]

#Assign current date to a variable.
today=$(date +"20%y%m%d")

#Select only accessioned content from the two files you want to compare and dump the output from both into a single file
grep -i "accessioned" $1 > final_file.csv
grep -i "accessioned" $2 >> final_file.csv

#For the new combined set of data, sort the remaining content and 
#remove all entries that are not unique. 
#Resort -- I used to think this step was necessary but I have since removed it without any problems -- and
#remove content from University Archives staff (those where the users are dhartwig and jejohns).
sort final_file.csv | uniq -u | grep -vE "(dhartwig|jejohns)"  > results$today.csv

#When finished, remove the temporary final_file.csv
rm final_file.csv
